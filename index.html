        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Welcome to SHARP MACHINE, Inc., where we are pioneering the next generation of AI. Our breakthrough technology transforms static models into adaptive, self-improving systems, ensuring your AI remains relevant and effective in a rapidly changing world.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="about" class="container">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>Company Vision</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to lead the transformation in AI by developing autonomous model maintenance agents. These agents ensure continuous improvement and adaptability, positioning SHARP MACHINE as the pioneer of the Sharp Machine era.</p>
        <h3>Founder's Story</h3>
        <p>In 2021, Deep Mukhopadhyay was struck by a statistic: 85% of AI systems fail in real-world applications. Inspired by this challenge and insights from AI expert Peter Norvig, Deep left his job to develop a solution. After two years of dedicated research, the breakthrough SHARP technology was born, laying the foundation for SHARP MACHINE, Inc.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="technology" class="container">
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <h3>The Breakthrough</h3>
        <p>SHARP technology marks a paradigm shift in AI development. Instead of traditional methods, our intelligent model sharpening engines leverage pre-trained ML models to create high-quality, adaptive models efficiently.</        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>The SHARP intelligence layer integrates seamlessly with existing AI ecosystems through API calls. It acts as an autonomous model maintenance agent, continuously updating models with new data.</p>

    <section id="market" class="container">
        <h2>Market Potential</h2>
        <h3>Unmet Needs</h3>
        <p>Despite advancements, 85% of AI models fail in real-world applications due to their inability to adapt to new data. SHARP addresses this critical gap by offering self-corrective predictive agents that continuously learn and improve.</p>
        <h3>Target Sectors</h3>
        <p>Our technology has vast applications across industries such as FinTech, EnergyTech, Autonomous Vehicles, and more. Companies like Lynx, a leading hedge fund, emphasize the need for adaptive models, highlighting significant demand for our solution.</p>
        <h3>Market Size</h3>
        <p>The AI sector is poised to reach a trillion-dollar market by 2026. Capturing just 5% of this market represents a $40 billion opportunity for SHARP over the next decade.</p>
