            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>SHARP MACHINE, Inc. is revolutionizing the AI landscape with intelligent model sharpening engines. Our autonomous model maintenance agents ensure that models remain up-to-date and effective in real-world scenarios.</p>
            <p>In a recent panel discussion, Lynx CEO Svante Bergstr√∂m emphasized the need for AI models that can learn and improve automatically from available data. Similarly, AI expert Peter Norvig highlighted the challenge of maintaining and updating AI models in unpredictable environments. SHARP MACHINE addresses these critical issues by providing self-corrective capabilities that allow models to adapt and improve with new data.</p>

        <div class="section" id="technology">
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>Our SHARP technology stands out by addressing the lifecycle of a model beyond its training stage. This innovation is crucial for autonomous agents and robots operating in dynamic real-world environments, such as drones, self-driving cars, warehouse robots, agricultural robots, and autonomous underwater vehicles.</p>
            <p>SHARP acts as an "autonomous model maintenance agent," ensuring models remain up-to-date by intelligently sharpening them as new data arrive. This represents a major shift from static "best trained" models to "self-corrective" predictive agents, reducing costs and time while enhancing safety.</p>
