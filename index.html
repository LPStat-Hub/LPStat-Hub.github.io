            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>SHARP MACHINE, Inc. is at the forefront of the AI revolution, developing intelligent model sharpening engines. Our autonomous model maintenance agents ensure models remain up-to-date and effective in real-world scenarios.</p>
            <p>We aim to lead the transformative "Sharp Machine" era, focusing on leveraging pre-trained models efficiently. This approach addresses unique insights and pain points in AI technology, setting us apart from other AI startups.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="technology">
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>Our technology addresses the lifecycle of a model beyond its training stage. SHARP technology continuously learns and improves from new data, rather than remaining static after training. This key innovation ensures models are robust and reliable in dynamic environments.</p>
            <p>SHARP acts as an "autonomous model maintenance agent," intelligently sharpening models as new data arrives. This major shift from static "best trained" models to "self-corrective" predictive agents significantly reduces costs and time while enhancing safety.</p>
