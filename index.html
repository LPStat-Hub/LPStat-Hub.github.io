            <h2>About Sharp Machine, Inc.</h2>
            <p>Sharp Machine, Inc. is pioneering a new paradigm in AI through our SHARP technology, which focuses on continuously sharpening and improving AI models autonomously. This technology addresses a critical gap in the market where 85% of AI models fail in real-world applications due to the lack of self-improvement capabilities.</p>
            <p>Founded by Deep Mukhopadhyay, Sharp Machine aims to revolutionize AI by reducing the need for constant manual intervention by ML engineers, offering a scalable, cost-effective solution for maintaining AI models in dynamic environments.</p>
            <h3>Why Sharp Machine Stands Out</h3>
            <p>Unlike traditional AI models that degrade over time, our SHARP technology ensures models continuously improve and adapt to new data, making them more reliable and effective in real-world scenarios. This innovation has the potential to drastically reduce operational costs and improve safety by minimizing human oversight.</p>

        <section id="market" class="section">
            <h2>Market Potential and Scalability</h2>
            <p>The AI technology sector is projected to reach a trillion-dollar market by 2026. Sharp Machine is uniquely positioned to capture a substantial share of this market by addressing the prevalent issue of model failure in real-world settings. Capturing just 5% of this market translates to a $40 billion opportunity over the next 5-10 years.</p>
            <p>Our modular integration with existing AI ecosystems (e.g., Google, AWS, Microsoft) ensures rapid deployment and scalability, which is essential for market penetration and growth.</p>

        <section id="technology" class="section">
            <h2>Revolutionary SHARP Technology</h2>
            <p>Our SHARP technology focuses on developing intelligent model sharpening engines that leverage open-source pre-trained ML models. This approach constructs high-quality models more efficiently and cost-effectively by continuously improving them with new data.</p>
            <p>SHARP acts as an “autonomous model maintenance agent,” ensuring the model remains up-to-date by intelligently sharpening it as new data arrives. This represents a major shift from providing clients with static "best-trained" ML models to offering "self-corrective" predictive agents.</p>
