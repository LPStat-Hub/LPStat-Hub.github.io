                <h2>Company Overview</h2>
                <p>In today's environment, where many founders are starting AI companies with little differentiation, it is crucial to highlight the unique insights and pain points that SHARP MACHINE, Inc. aims to address. This document outlines key aspects of the company, including its vision, research innovation, and technological advancements that distinguish it from the current AI landscape.</p>

                <h2>AI Model Development: The Imminent Paradigm Shift</h2>
                <p>SHARP MACHINE, Inc. is at the forefront of a significant shift in AI, driven by the availability of powerful open-source machine learning models. These models, which require substantial investment to train, are now accessible through platforms like Hugging Face. This dynamic is set to transform model development, moving away from traditional methods towards the development of intelligent model sharpening engines. These engines aim to construct high-quality models more efficiently by leveraging knowledge from pre-trained models. This approach represents the future of AI, where the focus will be on intelligent model sharpening rather than building models from scratch.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Customer Needs</h2>
                <p>An example of an unmet need that SHARP MACHINE, Inc. addresses is articulated by Svante Bergström, CEO of Lynx, during a panel discussion at the Swedish House of Finance. Bergström emphasized the need for AI models that can automatically learn and improve from available data, adapting to new information rather than following static, programmed instructions. This capability is essential not only for hedge funds but for nearly all current AI technologies, which often fail in real-world scenarios due to their inability to adapt.</p>

                <h2>Main Idea and Prototype</h2>
                <p>SHARP MACHINE, Inc. has developed a prototype based on the SHARP MACHINE concept. This prototype, created using R-software in collaboration with a former PhD student, demonstrates the effectiveness of SHARP technology compared to traditional methods such as fine-tuning. The research innovation of SHARP MACHINE, Inc. begins where traditional AI/ML ends, focusing on the lifecycle of a model beyond its training stage and into the unpredictable real world.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>SHARP Intelligence Layer and Nextgen AI Ecosystem Development</h2>
                <p>The SHARP intelligence layer will be integrated into the existing AI ecosystem through API calls, functioning as an autonomous model maintenance agent. This integration ensures that models remain up-to-date by intelligently sharpening them as new data becomes available. This represents a major shift from providing static "best trained" ML models to offering self-corrective predictive agents.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Business Model</h2>
                <p>SHARP MACHINE, Inc. will offer access to its SHARP cloud through APIs, employing appropriate authentication protocols. The company will provide tiered pricing with escalating AI capabilities suitable for businesses of all sizes. Pricing tiers include Essentials for small businesses and universities, Professional for growth, and Enterprise for larger clients, with costs based on the number of API calls per user/month.</p>

                <h2>Market Size Calculation</h2>
                <p>The AI technology sector is expected to reach a trillion-dollar market by the end of 2026. Currently, 85% of AI systems fail in real-world settings. If SHARP Technology captures just 5% of this market, it represents a $40 billion opportunity over the next 5-10 years.</p>
